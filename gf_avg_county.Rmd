```{r not-assigned}
load("data/total_cases.rda")
C <- ncol(total_cases)
total_cases <- total_cases[c(1, C)]
not_assigned <-total_cases %>% 
  filter(countyFIPS == "0") %>%
  select(-countyFIPS) %>%
  summarize_all(sum) 

current_total <- total_cases %>% 
  summarise(sum(total_cases[,2]))

perc_not_assigned <- not_assigned/current_total


na_print <- formatC(as.numeric(not_assigned), format="f", big.mark=",", digits=0)
pna_print <- percent(as.numeric(perc_not_assigned), accuracy = 0.001)
```

It is also interesting to look at the growth factor on the county level.  Although since most lock-down measures are enacted at the state level, this plot may not be that helpful.  In addition there are `r na_print` cases that have been not assigned to a county.  Although that only accounts for `r pna_print` of the total cases; it could have a big impact on a given state or county.  

```{r county-map, message = FALSE, results = "hide", warning = FALSE}
source("script/plot/county-map.R") #creates hex map of county avg gf for past n day

```



```{r county-map-img, out.width = "100%", fig.align = 'center'}
