Although most lock-down measures are enacted at the state level, it is still interesting to look at the growth factor on the county level.  

A limitation on this plot is that there are `r na_print` cases that have been not assigned to a county.  Although that only accounts for `r pna_print` of the total cases in the United States; it could have a big impact on a given county.  

```{r county-map, message = FALSE, results = "hide", warning = FALSE}
source("script/plot/county-map.R") #creates hex map of county avg gf for past n day
