These gifs are not as helpful as I hoped they would be and do not do a great job of showing trends.  This may be to the large fluctuations in growth factor and so getting a clear trend is difficult.  I'm keeping theme here because they look nice and they took me a long time to create; even though they don't provide much intellectual value.  

```{r hex-gif, message = FALSE, results = "hide", warning = FALSE}
source("script/plot/hex-gif.R") #creates gifs of hex map; all data and recent n days 
```


```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/hex_gif_recent.gif")
```

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/hex_gif_all.gif")
```
