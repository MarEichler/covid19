# Tracking COVID-19 in the United States

## Static Version

View static html here: [mareichler.github.io/covid19/](https://mareichler.github.io/covid19/)  

The static version needs to have the `index.Rmd` knitted everytime new data is available so is not always up to date since I don't run it every day.  



## Dynamic Version 

<!-- View dynamic app here: [mareichler.shinyapps.io/covid19/](https://mareichler.shinyapps.io/covid19/) -->
Comming soon!

The dynamic version will pull the most recent data from Johns Hopkins each time the page is loaded, so the its always using the most up to date data.  It takes a long time to load the plots and will reload.
