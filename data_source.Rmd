Data available through: `r max_date`  

```{r}
usafacts_data <- read.csv(link <- "https://usafactsstatic.blob.core.windows.net/public/data/covid-19/covid_confirmed_usafacts.csv")
max_date <- as.Date(colnames(usafacts_data)[ncol(usafacts_data)], format = "X%m.%d.%y")
```

This data is downloaded from 
<a href="https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/" target="_blank" >
USA Facts CDC</a>. I use two of the three spreadsheets, one with total cases and one with total deaths - both broken down by state and county.  This data requires additional formatting, calculation, and aggregation.  USA Facts gets data by county on a daily basis, this is totaled to get values for each day for the entire US. 

The
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html" target="_blank">
American CDC </a> 
links to USA Facts under Cases & Death by County, which is how I found the data source.
