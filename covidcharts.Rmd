One important calculation is the growth rate.  The growth rate is calculated as follows: 

$$
\text{Growth Rate} = \frac{ \text{New-Cases}_N}{\text{New-Cases}_{N-1}}
$$
where $N$ is a given day.  If the growth rate is below 1 that means the number of new cases is slowing down - this is a positive sign.  

I also wanted to look at the dealth percentage which I calculated as the total number of dealths divided by the total number of cases for a given day.  

```{r}
#number of rows; use for `for loop`  
R <- nrow(covid19_US)

#GROWTH FACTOR  
covid19_US$growth_factor <- NA

#calculate growth rate
#start with 2 because when r=1; 1-1= 0 (don't have a 0th row)
for (r in 2:R){
  covid19_US$`growth_factor`[r] <- 
    #Growth Factor = New Cases Today / New Cases Yesterday 
    covid19_US$new_cases[r] /  covid19_US$new_cases[r-1] 
}


#DEATH PERCENTAGE  
covid19_US$death_percentage <- NA

# calculate dealth percentage  
for (r in 1:R){
  covid19_US$death_percentage[r] <- 
    #dealth percentage = total deaths / total cases 
    covid19_US$total_deaths[r] /  covid19_US$total_cases[r] 
}

```

I am restricted the charts to show values after March 17, 2020 (first date in data set is March 18, 2020).  This is when preventative measures started to increase dramatically.  In addition, given the small number of cases prior to this date caused great variability in the growth rate and has multiple instances where it's  NA or equal to infinity.  

```{r}
startdate <- "2020-03-17"
#3/18 - start 'lockdown' ; after large growth factorsâ†•


covid19_US_adj <- covid19_US  %>%
  #only look at data after a given start date
  filter(date > as.Date(startdate)) %>%
  #remove any NA's that are still present 
  drop_na()
```


```{r}
#find current values to use as labels 

current_date <- max(covid19_US_adj$date)

current_values <- covid19_US_adj %>%
    #return row that has current date
    filter(date == current_date)


current_US_deaths      <- current_values$total_deaths
current_US_totalcases  <- current_values$total_cases
current_US_newcases <- current_values$new_cases
current_US_growthfact  <- current_values$growth_factor
current_US_deathperc   <- current_values$death_percentage
current_US_newdeaths <- current_values$new_deaths
```

```{r}
#set the limits for the x-axis
#want the limits to be the same so the axes for different charts line up
#need to add extra for the bar charts 

x_min <- as.Date(startdate)+.5
x_max <- as.Date(current_date)+1
```

###  Total Cases and Total Deaths  
These show the cumulative total of cases and deaths.  
```{r}

### Growth Factor and New Cases 
In order to see if the pandemic is slowing down, it is helpful to look at the growth factor and the daily new cases.  For both these values; we want to see a decrease in values from day to day - which indicates that less people are getting sick.  Recall that a growth factor less than 1 is a positive sign that the growth of cases is slowing down.  Growth factor is directly related to new cases - if daily new cases goes now the growth factor is less than 1; if daily cases goes up the growth factor is greater than one.  These two charts represent the same information in two differnt ways.  



```{r}
#growth factor by date line chart

#### Summary
